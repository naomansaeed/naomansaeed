### Academic Projects
- **Crime Reporting System**  
  A full-stack PHP/MySQL application designed to digitize crime reporting workflows in Punjab, Pakistan. I analyzed the analog system, designed the database schema, and implemented server logic and frontend forms independently as part of my BSIT capstone.

- **Scuba Diving Game in Godot Studio:**
  I made the whole thing by myself for the first time. It wasn't something thought in a tutorial. It was inspired from a flash game I remebered from childhood from a kids website. I had to figure out the logic of how to make stuff work the way I wanted. hardest part was the dynamic generation of terrain.
