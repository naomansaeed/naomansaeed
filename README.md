## Hi there 👋
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack Web Development at Scrimba [December 2025] 
### Past Projects 
- Scuba Diving Game in Godot Studio: I made the whole thing by myself for the first time. It wasn't something thought in a tutorial. It was inspired from a flash game I remebered from childhood from a kids website. I had to figure out the logic of how to make stuff work the way I wanted. hardest part was the dynamic generation of terrain.
